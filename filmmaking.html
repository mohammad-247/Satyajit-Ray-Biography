      <div class="p-4">

        <p>Satyajit Ray’s filmmaking journey truly began with his masterpiece — “Pather Panchali” (Song of the Little
          Road, 1955) — his directorial debut and the first film of what became known as the Apu Trilogy.</p>
        <h3>The Apu Trilogy</h3>
        <div class="p-2" id="patherPanchali">

          <h4>Pather Panchali (1955)</h4>
          <p>Based on Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay’s novel, Pather Panchali tells the story of Apu, a young boy growing
            up
            in rural Bengal, and his family’s struggles with poverty, dreams, and survival.
            Ray wanted to make a film that captured the truth of Indian village life — simple yet poetic.</p>
          <p>However, making Pather Panchali was anything but simple. Ray faced enormous challenges:
          <ul>
            <li>He had no previous filmmaking experience.</li>
            <li>Funding was nearly impossible to find — the film was financed partly by the Government of West Bengal
              after
              years of delay.</li>
            <li>Most of the cast were non-professional actors.</li>
            <li>Shooting took nearly three years (1952–1955) to complete.</li>
          </ul>
          Despite the hurdles, the result was extraordinary. The film’s realism, emotional depth, and music (composed by
          Pandit Ravi Shankar) touched audiences worldwide.
          When it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 1956, it won the Best Human Document Award and received a
          standing ovation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="p-2" id="aparajito">
          <h4>Aparajito (1956)</h4>
          <p>The second film of the trilogy continues Apu’s story as he moves from childhood to adolescence. It explores
            his relationship with his mother, Sarbojaya, and his growing independence as he pursues education in the
            city.</p>
          <p>Aparajito won the <strong>Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival</strong> and further established Ray as a
            world-class
            director. Its emotional honesty and attention to small details — like the sound of a train or a mother’s
            quiet worry — became Ray’s trademarks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="p-2" id="apurSansar">
          <h4>Aparajito (1959)</h4>
          <p>The final part of the trilogy shows Apu as a grown man navigating love, loss, and fatherhood. Starring
            <strong>Soumitra Chatterjee</strong> and <strong>Sharmila Tagore</strong> (in her debut), it’s a deeply
            moving story about resilience and
            hope.
          </p>
          <p>The film cemented Ray’s reputation as a master storyteller — simple, human, and profoundly emotional.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
          <p><strong>The Apu Trilogy</strong> collectively won over <strong>30 international awards</strong>, screened
            at major festivals (Cannes, Venice,
            Berlin), and is often ranked among the greatest achievements in film history.
            It introduced Indian cinema to the global art scene, showing the world that films from India could be both
            deeply local and universally human.</p>
          <p>This trilogy established Satyajit Ray as one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century, marking the
            birth of Indian parallel (realist) cinema.</p>
          <p>After the global success of The Apu Trilogy, Satyajit Ray continued to explore new subjects, styles, and
            storytelling forms. He never repeated himself — each film had its own identity, tone, and message.</p>
          <p>While Pather Panchali and its sequels focused on rural life and human struggle, Ray’s later films explored
            urban society, social change, gender roles, moral conflict, and the clash between tradition and modernity.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Jalsaghar (1958)</h4>
          <p>Ray’s first post-Apu film tells the story of Biswambhar Roy, an aging aristocrat obsessed with classical
            music even as his wealth and world crumble.
            The film is both a visual and emotional masterpiece, showing the decay of feudalism and the loneliness of a
            man clinging to a glorious past.
            The grand music sequences, composed by Ustad Vilayat Khan, remain among the most celebrated in Indian
            cinema.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Devi (1960)</h4>
          <p>In Devi, Ray questioned blind faith and superstition. The story follows a young woman, Doyamoyee, who is
            believed to be an incarnation of the goddess Kali. Her family’s devotion spirals into tragedy.
            This film stirred controversy in conservative circles but was praised internationally for its powerful
            storytelling and haunting imagery.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Mahanagar (1963)</h4>
          <p>A deeply human film about a middle-class housewife, Arati, who starts working to support her family —
            something uncommon in 1960s India.
            The film sensitively explores women’s independence, economic struggles, and social expectations, long before
            such topics became mainstream.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Charulata (1964)</h4>
          <p>Considered by many critics as Ray’s finest film, Charulata is based on a novella by Rabindranath Tagore. It
            depicts the emotional loneliness of a married woman who develops feelings for her husband’s cousin.
            Ray called it “the film closest to my heart.” Its graceful camera work, rich symbolism, and emotional
            subtlety make it a landmark in world cinema.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Nayak (1966)</h4>
          <p>A psychological drama about a film star reflecting on his life during a train journey. Starring Uttam
            Kumar, Bengal’s matinee idol, the film explores fame, regret, and identity.
            It’s both a self-reflective commentary on celebrity culture and an introspective look at the human mind.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (1969)</h4>
          <p>A total change in tone — this was Ray’s first fantasy musical, based on a story written by his grandfather.
            It follows two village musicians who are granted magical powers by the King of Ghosts.
            Filled with humor, music, and imagination, it became one of India’s most beloved children’s films. Ray later
            made two sequels: Hirak Rajar Deshe (1980) and Goopy Bagha Phire Elo (1992).</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>The Calcutta Trilogy</h3>
          <p>
            In the 1970s, Ray turned his focus to the social unrest and moral corruption in modern urban India.
          </p>
          <p>This trilogy includes:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Pratidwandi (1970)</strong>– about a young graduate struggling to find a job in a chaotic city.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Seemabaddha (1971)</strong>– showing the moral compromises of corporate ambition.</li>
            <li><strong>Jana Aranya (1975)</strong>– a chilling look at how economic pressure drives ordinary men to
              unethical choices.</li>
          </ol>
          Together, these films capture the socio-political turbulence of 1970s Kolkata.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>Shatranj Ke Khilari (1977)</h4>
          <p>Ray’s only Hindi feature film, starring Sanjeev Kumar, Saeed Jaffrey, and Amjad Khan, set in 1856 Lucknow.
            It depicts two noblemen obsessed with chess, ignoring the British annexation of their kingdom.
            The film blends history, irony, and political commentary — showing Ray’s mastery beyond Bengali cinema.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Later Films</h4>
          <p>
            In the 1980s and early 1990s, Ray’s health declined, but he continued working. Films like:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ghare-Baire</strong> (1984)</li>

            <li><strong>Ganashatru</strong> (1989)</li>

            <li><strong>Shakha Proshakha</strong> (1990)</li>

            <li> <strong>Agantuk</strong> (1991) — <strong>(his final film)</strong> — explored philosophy, idealism,
              and human values.</li>
          </ul>
          Even in his final years, Ray’s cinema retained its clarity, empathy, and moral vision.
