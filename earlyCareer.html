            <div class="p-4">

                <p>After completing his education at Santiniketan, Satyajit Ray returned to Calcutta and started his
                    professional life as a commercial artist. In 1943, he joined the <strong>British advertising agency D.J.
                        Keymer</strong>
                        (which later became Ogilvy & Mather) as a junior visualizer.</p>
                        <p>At first, Ray wasn’t fond of advertising, calling it <i>“a necessary compromise,”</i> but the job taught
                            him
                            valuable skills in design, layout, and visual communication — all of which he later applied to his film
                posters, credit titles, and compositions.</p>
            <p>While working in advertising, he also did freelance design work for the newly founded publishing house
                Signet
                Press, where he designed some of the most iconic book covers in Bengali literature. Among them was
                <strong>Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay</strong>’s novel “<strong>Pather Panchali</strong>”, whose story
                about a
                poor rural family deeply moved
                him — and would later inspire his first film.
            </p>
            <p>In 1947, Ray co-founded the <strong>Calcutta Film Society</strong> along with Chidananda Das Gupta and
                other
                film enthusiasts.
                This was a turning point — the society screened world cinema classics that were otherwise unavailable in
                India, allowing Ray to study the works of filmmakers like <strong>Jean Renoir, Charlie Chaplin, Vittorio
                    De
                    Sica,</strong>
                    and <strong>Sergei Eisenstein</strong>.</p>
                    <p>In <strong>1949</strong>, French filmmaker <strong>Jean Renoir</strong> came to India to shoot <i>The
                        River</i>. Ray met him and assisted him in
                        location scouting. Renoir encouraged him to follow his dream of becoming a filmmaker and advised him to
                        stay
                true to Indian themes rather than imitating Western styles.</p>
            <p>A year later, during a visit to London on a work trip for his ad agency, Ray watched <strong>Vittorio De
                Sica’s
                Italian neorealist film “Bicycle Thieves” (1948)</strong> — a film about ordinary people struggling
                in
                post-war
                poverty. Ray was deeply moved. He later said, <i>“I came out of the theater determined to become a
                    filmmaker.”</i>
                </p>
                <p>That moment solidified his vision: to make films about real people and real India, not fantasy or
                    melodrama —
                    and that dream became <strong><i>Pather Panchali</i></strong>.</p>
