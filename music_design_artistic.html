    <h2 class="pt-5 pb-5 text-decoration-underline">Music, Design and Artistic Talents</h2>
    <div class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column">
        <img src="satyajitRay12.png" class="rounded mb-1 img-fluid"  alt="">
      <div class="p-4">
        <p><strong>Satyajit Ray</strong> was not only a brilliant storyteller but also a true all-round artist — equally gifted in music,
          design, calligraphy, and illustration. His multidisciplinary talents gave his films and writings a distinct
          aesthetic identity that no one else could replicate.</p>
        <div class="p-2">
          <h4>Illustration and Design</h4>
          <p>Every story or book Ray wrote or edited was also visually his own — he designed the covers, drew the
            characters, and created the typography. His sense of visual storytelling extended seamlessly from cinema to the
            page.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p-2">
          <h4>Music Composition</h4>
          <p>Ray had no formal training in music, yet his understanding of melody, rhythm, and emotion was extraordinary. He
            composed the background scores and even songs for many of his own films.</p>
          <p>He often blended Indian classical instruments like the sitar, tabla, and flute with Western orchestral sounds,
            creating a unique cinematic language.</p>
          <p>Some of his most beautiful compositions appear in:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne</strong> (1969) – where he composed all the songs himself.</li>
            <li><strong>Charulata</strong> (1964) – featuring elegant, melancholic background music that perfectly captured
              the heroine’s
              emotions.</li>
            <li><strong>Hirak Rajar Deshe</strong> (1980) – filled with witty and satirical songs, all written and tuned by
              Ray.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="p-2">
          <h4>Graphic Design and Calligraphy</h4>
          <p>Before he became a director, Ray worked as a graphic designer and illustrator, and that artistic foundation
            never left him. He personally designed:
          <ul>
            <li>The posters, credit titles, and publicity materials for all his films.</li>
            <li>The logos for his production company Sukumar Ray Productions and Sandesh magazine.</li>
            <li> Unique typefaces and Bengali calligraphy styles that became his visual signature.</li>
          </ul>
          His poster for <i>Pather Panchali</i> (a sketch of little Apu and Durga walking through the fields) is considered
          one
          of the most iconic images in Indian cinema.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p-2">
          <h4>Attention to Aesthetic Detail</h4>
          <p>Ray was deeply inspired by the Bauhaus design movement, Japanese art, and Renaissance paintings, which can be
            seen in his balanced compositions and minimalist set designs.
            Even the costumes, props, and typography in his films reflected his sense of visual harmony.</p>
        </div>
        <p>In short, Satyajit Ray wasn’t just a director — he was a composer, painter, typographer, designer, and
          storyteller, all in one. His ability to unify these arts made his cinema visually poetic and emotionally powerful.
