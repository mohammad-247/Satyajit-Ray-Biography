      <div class="p-4">
        <p>In the early 1990s, after four decades of creating some of the finest films in world cinema, Satyajit Ray’s
          health began to decline. He suffered from heart and lung ailments, which worsened during the shooting of his
          last few films — Ganashatru (1989), Shakha Proshakha (1990), and Agantuk (1991).</p>
        <p>Despite his illness, he continued working from his hospital bed, reviewing edits and guiding his team. It was
          during this time that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided to honor him with the Honorary
          Oscar for lifetime achievement.

          Too weak to travel, Ray accepted the award via live video from his hospital in Kolkata. Holding the golden
          statuette, he said:
          <br>
          <i>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It’s been a wonderful experience to have worked in cinema for forty years... I never
            imagined I’d get such recognition.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>This moving moment was broadcast worldwide and is remembered as one of the most heartfelt tributes in Oscar
          history.</p>
        <p>Just a few weeks later, on April 23, 1992, Satyajit Ray passed away at the age of 70. India and the world
          mourned the loss of a true genius — the man who brought Indian cinema to the world stage.</p>
        <div class="p-2">
          <h4><strong>Legacy</strong></h4>
          <p>Satyajit Ray’s influence continues to live on — in films, literature, music, and design.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Global Inspiration</strong>:
            Directors like Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, Richard Attenborough, and Wes Anderson have all
            acknowledged Ray’s impact on their work.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Apu Trilogy’s Eternal Relevance</strong>:
            Pather Panchali, Aparajito, and Apur Sansar remain essential studies in film schools across the world,
            celebrated for their realism and emotional depth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Preservation and Restoration</strong>:
            In 2015, The Criterion Collection restored The Apu Trilogy negatives after decades of damage — ensuring that
            future generations can experience them in their full glory.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cultural Icon</strong>:
            Ray’s characters like Apu, Feluda, and Goopy-Bagha are deeply rooted in Indian culture — continuing to
            inspire films, books, plays, and art to this day.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI)</strong>:
            Established in Kolkata in 1995, this prestigious institute trains young filmmakers in his spirit of
            creativity
            and humanism.
          </p>
          <p>Ray’s storytelling celebrated the dignity of ordinary life, the poetry in simplicity, and the universality
            of human emotions.</p>
          <p>He once said:
            <br>
            <i>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <strong>“The best films are those that stay with you — not because of their grandeur, but because of their truth.”</strong></i>
          </p>
          <p>More than 30 years after his death, Satyajit Ray remains a beacon of integrity, creativity, and humanity — not only India’s greatest filmmaker, but <strong>one of the world’s greatest artists</strong>.</p>
